# JavaScript editor for [GTFS Pathways Data](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/examples/pathways/#)

*TODO: Update build workflow*
[![build](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/actions?query=workflow%3A%22build%22)

## Basics

A JavaScript-based tool to map transit stations, using the [GTFS Pathways Data](https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/examples/pathways/#) data specification. Developed by the [Taskar Center for Accessible Technology](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/).  

* It supports all popular modern desktop browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge.
* Pathways Editor is a fork of [iD OpenStreetMap Editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/tree/develop)
* Data is rendered with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).
* Check out [our roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for current & in-development features.

## Local Installation

Quick steps to install, build and run pathways locally:

### Building Pathways Editor

1. cd into the project folder
2. `npm clean-install` to install dependencies (`npm install` also works, but is slower as it also checks for available updates for the to be installed dependencies)
3. `npm run all` to generate static assets (translation strings, icons, etc.)
4. `npm start` to start up a development instance locally
5. open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a web browser

A few more useful commands are:

* `npm test` runs test suite: please execute these before submitting a pull request!
* `npm lint` checks for for code formatting mistakes
* `npm run build` generates a new production build. All files generated by this are stored in the self-contained `/dist` directory.


## Deploying a New Build

Pathways Editor deploys to GH Pages at [https://taskarcenteratuw.github.io/GTFS-Pathways-Editor](https://taskarcenteratuw.github.io/GTFS-Pathways-Editor)

### To deploy:

`npm run deploy` 

More details: this runs the `build` script then clones anything in the `/dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch. This branch only contains dist files and shouldn't be edited directly. GitHub automatically gets the updated files, the deployments can be seen [here](https://github.com/TaskarCenterAtUW/GTFS-Pathways-Editor/deployments).


## Development Information

Pathways Editor is a fork from iD Editor, an open-source project with 10+ years of development history. For this reason, development can be tricky to jump into. The best way to get familiar with the code style and patterns is to check out the documentation for iD Editor: [How to Get Started with iD Editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/wiki/How-to-get-started#build-and-test-instructions)

Other resources:

* iD Editor [architecture documentation](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/blob/develop/ARCHITECTURE.md) covers the basic functions of the code base
* Read up on [contributing and development style](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* See [open issues in the issue tracker](https://github.com/TaskarCenterAtUW/GTFS-Pathways-Editor/pulls?state=open)
if you're looking for contribution opportunities.
* TODO: add instructions for testing pre-release versions if we want to support that
